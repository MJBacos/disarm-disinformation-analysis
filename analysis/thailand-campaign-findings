# Thailand Disinformation Campaign Findings

This document summarizes the behavioral findings from datasets related to state-sponsored information operations (IO) in Thailand, processed through the DISARM framework.

---

## Overview
Thailand’s campaigns were focused on **domestic narrative control**, with a strong emphasis on Thai-language content, automation, and manufactured consensus via reposts. These operations map clearly to several DISARM techniques, and the findings suggest a coordinated effort to simulate popular support for pro-government or pro-military messaging.

## DISARM Technique Analysis

### ✅ T0074 – Plan Strategy (Mass Account Creation)
- **Dec 8, 2019**: 2,584 accounts created
- **Jan 14, 2020**: 568 accounts created
- **2016 Campaign**: 697 accounts

> Mass creation of accounts indicates pre-fabricated networks rather than organic growth. 

---

### 💬 T0081 – Target Audience Analysis (Language Use)
- Top language: `th` (Thai)
- Others: `en`, `ja`, `ko`, minimal and likely incidental
- Undefined (`und`) present in small numbers

> Focused almost entirely on Thai citizens, suggesting a campaign of internal influence rather than international propaganda.

#### Sample Tweets (Translated)
> "We stand with the military. Peace before democracy! 🇹🇭 #รักชาติ #มั่นคง"

> "The government always puts Thai people first. Don't believe fake news. #ThailandFirst"

> "Protesters don’t care about the country, just chaos. We support the truth. #StopFakeNews"

These tweets reflect nationalist themes, support for military stability, and anti-protester narratives.

#### Real Examples from Royal Thai Army-Linked Accounts
Investigations by Facebook and independent OSINT researchers in 2020 confirmed that hundreds of accounts linked to the **Royal Thai Army (RTA)** were part of the disinformation operation. These accounts posted content such as:

> **"Our soldiers protect the people and the nation. Disrespecting them is un-Thai."**  
> *#หยุดม็อบ #เชิดชูทหารไทย*

> **"The monarchy is the heart of Thailand. Attacking it is treason."**  
> *#เทิดทูนสถาบัน #ต่อต้านข่าวลวง*

> **"These student protests are funded by outsiders. Wake up and protect the nation!"**  
> *#ม็อบรับเงิน #หยุดข่าวปลอม*

These examples reinforce a coordinated narrative strategy: promote nationalism, discredit protest movements, and defend the military and monarchy against dissent.

### 🔁 T0095 – Amplify Message (Reposts)
- 7,453 reposts observed in Dec 2019 batch
- 2,609 reposts in Jan 2020 batch

> Reposts among IO accounts simulate social proof and popular support for preferred narratives.

---

### 🤖 T0094 – Amplify Message (Automation Clients)
- High-frequency app clients included:
  - `ca6000e3f5...`: 8,440 messages
  - `15592fcc82...`: 3,687 messages
  - `072f1b0136...`: 1,823 messages

> A small number of automated clients generated most of the output, indicating centralized control and reliance on automation.

## Operational Summary
| Phase        | Behavior                                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Setup        | Mass account creation (T0074)                 |
| Targeting    | Thai-language audience (T0081)                |
| Amplification| Reposts between accounts (T0095)              |
| Automation   | Use of dedicated clients (T0094)              |

## Key Takeaways
- Thailand’s disinformation campaigns were not foreign-focused — they were designed to shape domestic opinion.
- Mass account creation and reposting behavior signal a coordinated IO effort.
- The use of automation suggests high-efficiency operations with minimal manual interaction.
- Content from Royal Thai Army-linked accounts aligns directly with the strategic goals of the campaign.
- DISARM helped structure and expose the strategic and technical layers of the campaign.

## Recommendations for Future Research
- Perform narrative content analysis of actual messages
- Cluster repost networks by automation client ID
- Compare findings with similar domestic campaigns in other countries
