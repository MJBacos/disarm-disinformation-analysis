# Thailand State-Sponsored Disinformation Analysis via DISARM Framework

## 📂 Project Overview
This project focuses on processing and preparing public datasets of **state-sponsored disinformation campaigns** originating from **Thailand**. The data is structured to be compatible with the [DISARM Framework](https://disarm.foundation/) for behavior analysis and visualization.

The repository includes:
- Raw **Parquet** files
- **Scripts** for converting Parquet to CSV and CSV to DISARM-compatible JSON
- Final **JSON files** ready to load into the DISARM Navigator

---

## 🔗 Dataset Source
- Downloaded from [Zenodo: State-Sponsored Disinformation Campaigns](https://zenodo.org/records/14189193)
- Provided in **Parquet (.parquet)** format


## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Download raw Parquet files** from Zenodo.
2. **Use provided scripts** to:
   - Convert Parquet ➔ CSV
   - Convert CSV ➔ DISARM-compatible JSON
3. **Load JSON layers** into DISARM Navigator to map disinformation behaviors.


---

## 🧵 Why Parquet ➔ CSV ➔ JSON?
- **Parquet is optimized for analytics**, not for structured metadata use.
- **CSV enables easier inspection** and cleaning before metadata mapping.
- **JSON** aligns the data with the required DISARM Navigator format.

In short:
> **Parquet ➔ CSV ➔ JSON ensures accuracy, quality control, and usability for DISARM analysis.**
